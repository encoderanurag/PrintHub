     About Us
  </h1>

     <p class="About-para"> Welcome to PrintHub, your number one source for all your printing related needs. We're dedicated to giving you the very best, with a focus on product quality, customer service and uniqueness.

      Founded in 2020, PrintHub has to go a long way from where it is. The main purpose behind founding PrintHub is the current lackness of printing resources for students of printing technology. We provide you the best possible printing resources available on the internet, furthermore it's free. 
      <br>
      We have a very limited team which works for you and give you their knowledge. Our team members give their important time to share their knowledge with you, moreover they work as a voluntier so I'm very greatful to all of them.
      
      <h3 class="about-para-h3"> What we do for students and why?</h3>

      It's time to introduce myself before coming back to the topic. I'm Anurag Tiwari. I have a diploma in printing technology from Northern Regional Institute of Printing technology, Prayagraj, India and now I'm pursuing B.Tech in printing technology. <br>
      As a student of printing technology, I noticed through out my diploma that if you're a printing technology student you have very limited resourse even after being a part one of the oldest industry. You usually don't get all your notes on internet like other technical students get. So I thought I should give something to those who are going to join printing industry in upcoming years. As a result I started out this website to help the printing technology students. 

      <h3 class="about-para-h3"> Why we?</h3>
      When PrintHub first started out, my passion for printing technology drove me to do build this website, and gave me the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into to a booming online store of education for students of printing technology. We now serve students all over the world, and are thrilled to be an unique part of the printig industry.
      
      I hope you enjoy our resources as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.
      
      Sincerely,
      Anurag Tiwari
        </p>
